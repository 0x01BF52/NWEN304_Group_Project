Set up express server

added functionality for calls to the express server to get infromation using GET request that respond with JSON for the object requested, e.g. if /products is requested it will return the JSON file with all the product info.

Added node modules:
Express - Server
Nodemom - Allows to live update the server without needing to restart it
Concurrently - Allows both front end and back end to be launched with one Command.

Lauching Server:
first you need to cd into the server folder
in the terminal type: npm run dev
this will lauch the react app and the express server at the same time.

To see whats on the express server, it is currently set up to view on http://localhost:5000
